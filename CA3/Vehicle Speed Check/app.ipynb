    "## **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses Haar Cascade for detecting cars and Dlib’s correlation tracker for continuous tracking across frames. Every 10 frames, the system detects new cars, and their positions are tracked. The speed of each car is calculated based on the distance it travels between consecutive frames. This speed is displayed as text on the video feed. \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Requirements**\n",
    "- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy\n",
    "- **File Structure**:\n",
    "  - Model files (e.g., `myhaar.xml`) are located in the `models/` directory.\n",
    "  - Video files (e.g., `cars.mp4`) are located in the `videos/` directory.\n",
    "  - Output video is saved in the current directory as `outpy.avi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Outputs**\n",
    "1. **Video**:\n",
    "   - Original video with detected cars tracked and their speeds displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sample Outputs**\n",
    "- Processed video saved as `outpy.avi` with bounding boxes and speed annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Algorithm Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Car Detection**:\n",
    "   - A Haar Cascade model is used to detect cars in the video frames. Detection occurs every 10 frames to identify new cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tracking with Dlib**:\n",
    "   - Dlib’s `correlation_tracker` is used to continuously track the detected cars. A tracker is created for each detected car, and its position is updated in subsequent frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed Estimation**:\n",
    "   - The speed is estimated by calculating the distance between a car’s position in two consecutive frames and converting the distance from pixels to meters. The speed is displayed on the video feed in km/hr.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Frame Processing**:\n",
    "   - The system tracks multiple cars and removes trackers for cars no longer detected. It updates the positions of the remaining tracked cars and recalculates their speeds as they move across the frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Generation**:\n",
    "   - The processed video is saved and displayed, with bounding boxes around tracked cars and speed annotations displayed on the screen."
